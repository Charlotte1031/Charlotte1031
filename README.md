Hi, I’m Charlotte Xu, a Statistician, clinical trial researcher, and open-source contributor. I love tackling real-world challenges with data, but beyond that, I’m also a Sound Engineer, filmmaker, media producer, drummer, and avid snowboarder. 🎥🎶🏂

- 🎸 I’m part of a band and am a rookie drummer!
-	🎬 I'm a FOH sound engineer, a photographer and a media producer.
-	🏔️ Find me at Mountains during winter and I will be snowboarding :)
